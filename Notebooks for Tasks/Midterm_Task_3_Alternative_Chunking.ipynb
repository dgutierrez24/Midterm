       " 'answer': 'Healthcare navigators assist individuals by helping them navigate online signup forms to choose and obtain healthcare coverage. They are trained individuals or organizations that aid consumers, small businesses, and their employees in exploring health coverage options through the Marketplace, which is a government website. This includes assisting with the completion of eligibility and enrollment forms. For the 2022 plan year, the Biden-Harris Administration increased funding to train and certify more than 1,500 navigators to help uninsured consumers find affordable and comprehensive health coverage.',\n",

A Navigator is “an individual or organization that's trained and able to help \\nconsumers, small businesses, and their employees as they look for health coverage options through the \\nMarketplace (a government web site), including completing eligibility and enrollment forms.”106 For \\nthe 2022 plan year, the Biden-Harris Administration increased funding so that grantee organizations could \\n“train and certify more than 1,500 Navigators to help uninsured consumers find affordable and comprehensive \\nhealth coverage.”107\\nThe customer service industry has successfully integrated automated services such as \\nchat-bots and AI-driven call response systems with escalation to a human support \\nteam.108 Many businesses now use partially automated customer service platforms that help answer customer \\nquestions and compile common problems for human agents to review. These integrated human-AI \\nsystems allow companies to provide faster customer care while maintaining human agents to answer \\ncalls or otherwise respond to complicated requests. Using both AI and human agents is viewed as key to \\nsuccessful customer service.109\\nBallot curing laws in at least 24 states require a fallback system that allows voters to \\ncorrect their ballot and have it counted in the case that a voter signature matching \\nalgorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or there is another issue with their \\nballot, and review by an election official does not rectify the problem. Some federal \\ncourts have found that such cure procedures are constitutionally required.110 \\nBallot \\ncuring processes vary among states, and include direct phone calls, emails, or mail contact by election \\nofficials.111 Voters are asked to provide alternative information or a new signature to verify the validity of their \\nballot. \\n52\",\n",

Khadijah Abdurahman, Tech Impact Network Research Fellow, AI Now Institute, UCLA C2I1, and\\nUWA Law School\\nPanelists separately described the increasing scope of technology use in providing for social welfare, including \\nin fraud detection, digital ID systems, and other methods focused on improving efficiency and reducing cost. \\nHowever, various panelists individually cautioned that these systems may reduce burden for government \\nagencies by increasing the burden and agency of people using and interacting with these technologies. \\nAdditionally, these systems can produce feedback loops and compounded harm, collecting data from \\ncommunities and using it to reinforce inequality. Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \\nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \\nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \\nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \\ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \\nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \\nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \\nthem. \\nPanel 6: The Healthcare System.
