How do healthcare navigators assist individuals in finding and obtaining healthcare coverage?,"["" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHUMAN ALTERNATIVES, \nCONSIDERATION, AND \nFALLBACK \nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE\nReal-life examples of how these principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practical \ntechnical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \nHealthcare “navigators” help people find their way through online signup forms to choose \nand obtain healthcare. A Navigator is “an individual or organization that's trained and able to help \nconsumers, small businesses, and their employees as they look for health coverage options through the \nMarketplace (a government web site), including completing eligibility and enrollment forms.”106 For \nthe 2022 plan year, the Biden-Harris Administration increased funding so that grantee organizations could \n“train and certify more than 1,500 Navigators to help uninsured consumers find affordable and comprehensive \nhealth coverage.”107\nThe customer service industry has successfully integrated automated services such as \nchat-bots and AI-driven call response systems with escalation to a human support \nteam.108 Many businesses now use partially automated customer service platforms that help answer customer \nquestions and compile common problems for human agents to review. These integrated human-AI \nsystems allow companies to provide faster customer care while maintaining human agents to answer \ncalls or otherwise respond to complicated requests. Using both AI and human agents is viewed as key to \nsuccessful customer service.109\nBallot curing laws in at least 24 states require a fallback system that allows voters to \ncorrect their ballot and have it counted in the case that a voter signature matching \nalgorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or there is another issue with their \nballot, and review by an election official does not rectify the problem. Some federal \ncourts have found that such cure procedures are constitutionally required.110 \nBallot \ncuring processes vary among states, and include direct phone calls, emails, or mail contact by election \nofficials.111 Voters are asked to provide alternative information or a new signature to verify the validity of their \nballot. \n52\n""]","Healthcare navigators assist individuals in finding and obtaining healthcare coverage by helping them navigate online signup forms, choose appropriate health coverage options through the Marketplace, and complete eligibility and enrollment forms.

Enhancing Content Provenance through Structured Public Feedback \nWhile indirect feedback methods such as automated error collection systems are useful, they often lack \nthe context and depth that direct input from end users can provide.

Furthermore, organizations can track and document the provenance of datasets to identify \ninstances in which AI-generated data is a potential root cause of performance issues with the GAI \nsystem. \nA.1.8. Incident Disclosure \nOverview \nAI incidents can be deﬁned as an “event, circumstance, or series of events where the development, use, \nor malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly contributes to one of the following harms: \ninjury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people (including psychological harms and harms to \nmental health); disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; violations of \nhuman rights or a breach of obligations under applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labor, \nand intellectual property rights; or harm to property, communities, or the environment.” AI incidents can \noccur in the aggregate (i.e., for systemic discrimination) or acutely (i.e., for one individual). \nState of AI Incident Tracking and Disclosure \nFormal channels do not currently exist to report and document AI incidents.

"How have advocates, researchers, and government organizations proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems?","['SECTION TITLE\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThere are regulatory safety requirements for medical devices, as well as sector-, population-, or technology-spe\xad\ncific privacy and security protections. Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \nmoving principles into practice. \nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\xad\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \nother countries. \nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\xad\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\xad\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\xad\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government’s use of AI. The Blueprint \nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \n9\n']","Advocates, researchers, and government organizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems.

How to manage risks of GAI with third-party components and human misuse?,"[' \n12 \nCSAM. Even when trained on “clean” data, increasingly capable GAI models can synthesize or produce \nsynthetic NCII and CSAM. Websites, mobile apps, and custom-built models that generate synthetic NCII \nhave moved from niche internet forums to mainstream, automated, and scaled online businesses.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Privacy Enhanced \n2.12. \nValue Chain and Component Integration \nGAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, \nand software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading \nto diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI \nsystems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the \ntraining data, which may be too large for humans to vet; the diﬃculty of training foundation models, \nwhich leads to extensive reuse of limited numbers of models; and the extent to which GAI may be \nintegrated into other devices and services. As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party \ncomponents and data sources, it may be diﬃcult to attribute issues in a system’s behavior to any one of \nthese sources. \nErrors in third-party GAI components can also have downstream impacts on accuracy and robustness. \nFor example, test datasets commonly used to benchmark or validate models can contain label errors. \nInaccuracies in these labels can impact the “stability” or robustness of these benchmarks, which many \nGAI practitioners consider during the model selection process.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair with \nHarmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable \n3. \nSuggested Actions to Manage GAI Risks \nThe following suggested actions target risks unique to or exacerbated by GAI. \nIn addition to the suggested actions below, AI risk management activities and actions set forth in the AI \nRMF 1.0 and Playbook are already applicable for managing GAI risks. Organizations are encouraged to \napply the activities suggested in the AI RMF and its Playbook when managing the risk of GAI systems.  \nImplementation of the suggested actions will vary depending on the type of risk, characteristics of GAI \nsystems, stage of the GAI lifecycle, and relevant AI actors involved.  \nSuggested actions to manage GAI risks can be found in the tables below: \n• \nThe suggested actions are organized by relevant AI RMF subcategories to streamline these \nactivities alongside implementation of the AI RMF.  \n• \nNot every subcategory of the AI RMF is included in this document.13 Suggested actions are \nlisted for only some subcategories.  \n \n \n13 As this document was focused on the GAI PWG eﬀorts and primary considerations (see Appendix A), AI RMF \nsubcategories not addressed here may be added later.  \n', ' \n3 \nthe abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result \nfrom interactions between a human and an AI system.  \n• \nTime scale: GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods. Examples include \nimmediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the \ndistribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term eﬀect of disinformation on societal \ntrust in public institutions. \nThe presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the \ncharacteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not \nlimited to GAI model or system architecture, training mechanisms and libraries, data types used for \ntraining or ﬁne-tuning, levels of model access or availability of model weights, and application or use \ncase context. \nOrganizations may choose to tailor how they measure GAI risks based on these characteristics. They may \nadditionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of \nnegative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts \nharms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may diﬀer from mitigations \nfor use-case or ecosystem level risks. \nImportantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore diﬃcult to properly scope or evaluate given \nthe uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but \ndiﬃcult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with \nrisk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature \nstate of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there \nis an existing empirical evidence base at the time this proﬁle was written; for example, speculative risks \nthat may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may \nincorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identiﬁed below. \nTo guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by \nthe development and use of GAI are deﬁned below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, \nobject, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks “to” a subject or domain and others are risks “of” or \n“from” an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute \nrisk management eﬀorts. To help streamline risk management eﬀorts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 \n(as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identiﬁed in the AI RMF.  \n \n \n5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk deﬁnition \nand management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK’s International \nScientiﬁc Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: 1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction): \nConfabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; \nHarmful Bias, and Homogenization; 2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use): CBRN Information or Capabilities; \nData Privacy; Human-AI Conﬁguration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; \nInformation Security; 3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks): Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual \nProperty.

This algorithmic impact assessment should be made public whenever \npossible. Reporting should be provided in a clear and machine-readable manner using plain language to \nallow for more straightforward public accountability. \n28\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n', "" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nEnsuring accessibility during design, development, and deployment. Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\xad\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\xad\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\xad\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\xad\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\xad\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\xad\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \njustification for any continued use of the system. \nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. \nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\xad\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\xad\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \n27\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n""]",The answer to given question is not present in context,multi_context,"[{'source': '/Users/danielgutierrez/Midterm/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/danielgutierrez/Midterm/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'page': 27, 'total_pages': 73, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Illustrator 26.3 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creationDate': ""D:20220920133035-04'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20221003104118-04'00'"", 'trapped': ''}, {'source': '/Users/danielgutierrez/Midterm/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/danielgutierrez/Midterm/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'page': 26, 'total_pages': 73, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Illustrator 26.3 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creationDate': ""D:20220920133035-04'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20221003104118-04'00'"", 'trapped': ''}]",True

These principles—while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI—require that AI is: (a) lawful and \nrespectful of our Nation’s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. \nAffected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them. \nThe law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulations—and \nmeasures to address harms when they occur—can enhance innovation in the context of com-\nplex technologies. Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers’ ability to \ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \nand effectiveness concerns. \nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \nharmful \nuses. \nThe \nNIST \nframework \nwill \nconsider \nand \nencompass \nprinciples \nsuch \nas \ntransparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design, design and development, deployment, use, \nand testing and evaluation of AI technologies and systems.

"What steps are needed in automated systems for public safety, including consultation, testing, and risk identification?","[' \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSAFE AND EFFECTIVE \nSYSTEMS \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nIn order to ensure that an automated system is safe and effective, it should include safeguards to protect the \npublic from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner; avoid use of data inappropriate for or irrelevant to the task \nat hand, including reuse that could cause compounded harm; and demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of \nthe system. These expectations are explained below. \nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\xad\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\xad\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\xad\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\xad\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \npotential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\xad\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\xad\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated.
