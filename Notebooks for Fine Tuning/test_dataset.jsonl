Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. \nAI risks can di\ufb00er from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI \nrisks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions: \n\u2022 \nStage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, \nand/or decommissioning. \n\u2022", "45e25e58-94b6-4c28-9bd6-73460341b068": "\u2022 \nScope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation \nlevels (i.e., for a speci\ufb01c use case), or at the ecosystem level \u2013 that is, beyond a single system or \norganizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of \u201calgorithmic \nmonocultures,3\u201d resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to \nopportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 \n\u2022 \nSource of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, \nfrom GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including", "08021e56-012b-492c-aaee-0c804da5d440": "3 \u201cAlgorithmic monocultures\u201d refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in \nconsequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by \nsystems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm.  \n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \nthe impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and \nemployers are pondering this disruption.", "fe3b575b-20e3-4c77-93c6-e6659c1a13cb": "3 \nthe abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result \nfrom interactions between a human and an AI system.  \n\u2022 \nTime scale: GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods.
